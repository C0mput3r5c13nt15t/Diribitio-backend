# diribitio - The backend

## Hello!
Welcome to my webapplication. Just take a look around!  
If you like what you see concider writing me a nice e-mail with some feedback!

## About the API
Right here you can see the Backend of my Webapplication. It was build using the php framework Laravel. It consists of three user-types with an jwt authentification and email notifications for account verification and a passwort reset. Further there are projects which can be created and managed by students and leaders, students can also participate in these projects by signing up for a least three of all possible projects. Then an anmin sorts them into their projects. After that they can post exchange requests to exchange projects with an other student. All of this is scheduled and controlled by the admins.

## Can I get the project?
At the current point in time, because the app is still in deveploment and hasn't been tested enought. Once all of this is done there will be a link to the git-repository with the full project and an installation guide for setting it up on a server. So just be patient! If you are interested, just conatct me via email!

## Who did this?
Basically just me :-) and if you want to conatct me here's my email:
